# README

* Ruby version: 2.4.0

* System dependencies:

  - This is using Rails 5.1, with Webpacker, which bakes Webpack support into the asset pipeline -- Awesome!

  - It also has React built in via Webpacker

* Server Running:

  - Using Foreman to run both the webpack-dev-server and rails server in one

  - run `bin/server` to start both services.

    - you may need to `chmod 777 bin/server` if permission is denied to that stub

  - open localhost:5000, which will serve Rails + React with Hot Module Reloading
