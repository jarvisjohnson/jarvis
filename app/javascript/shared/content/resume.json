    "summary": "Richard hails from Tulsa. He has earned degrees from the University of Oklahoma and Stanford. (Go Sooners and Cardinals!) Before starting Pied Piper, he worked for Hooli as a part time software developer. While his work focuses on applied information theory, mostly optimizing lossless compression schema of both the length-limited and adaptive variants, his non-work interests range widely, everything from quantum computing to chaos theory. He could tell you about it, but THAT would NOT be a “length-limited” conversation!",

He made it known that he desired a more technical role, and this led him to complete a software course outside of work hours, which we supported. Above all, we miss his humour and Jarvis is often talked about in the office; I’m sure he would have the same impact at any company. I'd take him back any day!."

He learned the basics of WordPress front and back end development very quickly, allowing him to become an immediate asset to us.Jarvis even helped us improve our own workflows, introducing us to technologies such as SASS and Grunt.  His previous career experience was evident as he knew how to handle our stakeholders. Our trust in each other as developers has since found us sharing leads between our business and Swish, Jarvis’s own development business.  Whatever development and web engineering roles Jarvis is looking into I’m certain he’ll be a great asset and push the product forward, as he did with us."
